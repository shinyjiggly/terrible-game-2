#      HERETIC's MAP DEATH
#      Version 1.0
#      Tuesday, May 29th, 2012
#
#==============================================================================
#
#  ---  Overview  ---
#
#  This script will bring up the Game Over screen any time everyone in your
#  party Dies, due to Poison or other Damage Slip Inflicted States.  It can
#  be turned On and Off with a Game Switch, or simply set to true for being
#  on the entire time.
#
#
#  -----  Features  -----
#
#  - Customizable
#  - Other Animations still take place on Map Screen
#
#  ---  Instructions  ---
#
#  Change GAME SWITCH to ON to allow Game Over when everyone in your Party
#  has died at any time for any reason.  It can be turned off for places
#  that wouldnt make sense to Game Over if Party Dead, like In Town.
#
#  Switch Number can be changed to whatever Game Switch Number you want.
#
#  ---  Options  ---
#
#  WINDOW_DELAY - How long to wait between Death and Msg, and Msg and Game Over.
#  
#
